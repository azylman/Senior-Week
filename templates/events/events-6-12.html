Ticket includes bus to and from Navy Pier (buses load at 7pm at various locations around campus) and hor d'oeuvres on the boat. A cash bar is available, which is why this event is 21+ only. Cruise goes from 8:30 to 11pm, and you're free to continue the party downtown or take the buses back to Evanston.
